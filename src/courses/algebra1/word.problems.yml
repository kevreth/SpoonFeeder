        A _word problem_ expresses a math problem in English. The most basic word problems are obviously solved by basic arithmetic. For example

        * Sally has 7 apples, and her friend gives her 3 more. How many apples does Sally have now? (7+3=10)
        * If four boxes contain 6 pencils each, how many pencils are there in total? (4x6=24)
        * If a movie starts at 3:30 and lasts for 2 hours, what time will it end? (3:30+2:00=5:30)

        Complex word problems require a procedure to solve.

        *Word Problem Procedure*

        . *Read* the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood
        . *Decorate* the problem by crossing out distractors and underlining necessary information.
        . *Identify*
          * the type of problem
          * the formula
          * entities
          * variables

        . *Tabulate* the equation, with one column for each variable.
        . *Translate* the results into equations.
        . *Solve* the equation.
        . *Check* both the equation results and the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.

        _Sarah wants to plant flowers in her rectangular garden. The length of the garden is 6 feet, and the width is 4 feet. What is the area of her garden plot?_

        Such a simple example can easily be solved without this process, but the example is being kept simple for clarity.

        Step 1

        *Read* the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Notice some key words:

        . rectangular
        . length
        . width
        . area

        Step 2
        *Decorate* the problem by crossing out distractors and underlining necessary information.

        _Distractors_ are extra verbiage that do not contribute to the problem. Distractors exercise your ability to separate relevant and irrelevant information. You may want to [line-through]#*cross out*# distractors.

        [.underline]#Underline# verbiage that describes

        . The type of problem ("rectangular")
        . Variable names ("length", "width")
        . Quantities ("4", "6")
        . The requirement ("area")

        Together, these provide all infomation necessary to solve the problem.

        Tabulating is a four-step sub-process. First, we construct the basic table. There's the header row, a row for each type of coin, and a total row. The header row is filled with the type of coin and the variables in the equation. Notice that we flipped the sides of the equation to put the total value on the right side.

        \(0.01\)

        \(0.01(2n_q)\)

        2.43

        We need to think: the problem says the number of pennies is twice the number of quarters and that we are looking for the number of coins of each type. We need to create a variable, \(q\), to represent the number of quarters. The number of quarters is \(q\), and the number of pennies is \(2q\). We enter that in our table. +
        *This variable substitution step is the most difficult part of the entire word problem solving process.* Think about it carefully! +
        We could have selected the variable \(p\) for pennies instead, but that entails division where quarters equals \(\frac\{p}\{2}\). Division is more complicated than multiplication.

        0.01

        \(0.01(2n_q)\)

        2.43

        Perform algebra to create expressions representing the total value of each coin. The final column represents a new equation used in the next step. Notice that the ultimate purpose of the table is to *derive an equation that relates each instance of the original formula* (two instances, quarters and pennies). The last column provides the _relationship_ between pennies and quarters.

        \(TV_p\)

        \(TV_q+TV_p\)

        For illustration purposes only, you can see how variables used in the identification section correspond to the table. So, \[E_q: n_q+v_q=TV_q\] \[E_p: n_p+v_p=TV_p\] However, stating this while working problems is not useful.

        |Before adding data to our table, we need to perform some algebra. The basic equations from the problem are \[x+8=y\] \[x+y=26\] To make the format of the equation fit a table the first equation needs to have y moved to the left side and the constant moved to the right side: \[x-y=-8\] Now both equations are in the same form, the x-term in the first position, the y-term in the second position, and a constant on the right side.

        6

        Translate

        \(2x=18\) +
        \(y=x+8\)

        The second equation derives from the first row of the table. We could also have chosen \(y=26-x\).

        7

        Solve

        x=9 +
        y=17

        Solve the first equation (\(2x=18\)) then use that solution in the second equation. (\(y=x+8=9+8=17\))

        8

        Check

        \(9+17=26\) ✓

        We go back to the original statement of the equations and pick the equation that wasn't used in the *solve* step. \[x+y=26\]

        State
