|===
| Letter | Type | Description

| `-`
| Regular file
| A standard file that can contain data, text, or program instructions.

| `d`
| Directory
| A file that contains a list of other files and directories.

| `l`
| Symbolic link
| A special file that serves as a reference or pointer to another file or directory, similar to a shortcut.

| `b`
| Block device
| Represents buffered access to hardware devices and allows data to be read and written in blocks (e.g., hard disks, CD-ROM drives).

| `c`
| Character device
| Represents unbuffered, direct access to hardware devices that do not have a block structure (e.g., serial ports, printers).

| `p`
| Named pipe (FIFO)
| Used for inter-process communication, acting as a conduit to allow two processes to communicate.

| `s`
| Socket
| Used for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to pass data between processes, commonly in networked services.
