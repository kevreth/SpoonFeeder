== Option arguments
=== Two meanings of "argument"

Like "command", "argument" has multiple meanings.

In `ls -a -l /home/bob`

=== Anatomy of a command 3

The presence of option arguments and combined options raises a question. Can all this be combined?

`-a arg -def`

The answer is 'yes', but there's some rules. Combining these would look like

`-defa arg`

The rules combining options are:

. Only one option requiring an argument may be used
. The option requiring an argument must be last

There is no way to further combine (arg1 is an argument to option e)

`-dfe arg1 -a arg2`

=== A command with multiple options and parameters

Given this directory structure

[source]
----
sales
  client_contact
    client_list.csv
  sales_reports
    sales_report_Jan.csv
    sales_forecast_Q1.pdf
----

[source, bash]
----
cd /sales_reports/
ls -1
sales_report_Jan.csv
sales_forecast_Q1.pdf
----

`-1` is an _option_ to display directory entries in a single column.

=== Options are of two types

* Short options are one letter preceded by dash
* long options are multiple letters and preceded by two dashes

Short options can usually be combined, such as

ls -(something)

in this case, only the final option can be passed a parameter.

Note that Bash commands aren't always consistent in the way they use options and parameters. some allow long options, some don't.

== Globbing

=== Absolute vs relative paths
So far, if we wanted to address a directory or a file in a directory that is not CWD, we typed out the entire path

/home/bob/bash-tutorial/test.txt

This is called an _absolute path_. Absolute paths are always from the perspective of the root directory.

Typing put all those paths is a chore. As a shortcut, Bash offers _relative paths_ which are from the perspective of the CWD. The reason in previous examples we didn't need to add paths when working with the contents of home/bon/bash-tutorial is because we were using relative paths.

Lets make bash-tut our current directory, create a directory in it, and create a file.

cd bash-tutorial
mkdir lesson1
cd lesson1

In all three cases we used relative paths. Using absolute paths would require

mkdir /home/bob/bash-tutorial/lesson1
cd /home/bob/bash-tutorial/lesson1

=== . and ..

Notice when using `la -d`theres two extra entries

.
..

. refers to the current directory. we may use it in certain circumstances, such as executing a program EXAMPLES

.. refers to the parent directory. we can use it as a shortcut in relative paths

cd ..

CWD is now /home/bob/.

=== don't change CWD for short tasks
Most commands take a path parameter if you only need to perform pne task don't change CWD. Instead, pass a path parameter to the command, if the command takes it.

EXAMPLE


== Users and groups

As a multi-user operating system, Linux maintains strict permissions on who can access files. You wouldn't for example want another user accessing your files, which may contain private information or someone maliciously deletes your data. Every object in the filesystem has an associated set of permissions

* read
* write
* execute

That are repeated three times

* owner
* group
* world

combined, three are nine permissions

The big difference between files and directories when using these permissions is that "executing" a directory means making it the CWD, i.e., `cd`-ing into it.

=== groups

A group in Linux is a named set if users that are treated as a user. A group may contain users or groups

The owner of a file may be a user or a group.

The group of a file grants access to any group the owner is a member of.

World means anyone.

=== touch

Let's create a set of test files to play with permissions. The `touch` command updates the timestamp of a file to the current time and creates an empty file if it doesn't exist.

 touch file1 file2 file3

=== changing file permissions

 the `chmod` command changes the 000

== File commands
=== Determine file type: `file`
=== Paginate long output: `less`
=== Print lines that match patterns: `grep`
=== Change file timestamps: `touch`
=== Create empty files: `touch`
=== Create symbolic links: `ln`
=== Searching the filesystem: `find`
=== Executing commands on found objects: `xargs`
=== Estimate disk usage of a directory tree: `du`

== Process commands
=== Introduction
The commands we have used so far either run instantly or in a short amount of time. Some however take a long time to execute or are designed to never stop.

A command that is currently executing is called a _process_.

=== ps—Report a snapshot of current processes.
=== top—Display tasks.
=== jobs—List active jobs.
=== bg—Place a job in the background.
=== fg—Place a job in the foreground.
=== kill—Send a signal to a process.

== Filesystem permissions
=== id—Display user identity.
=== chmod—Change a file's mode.
=== umask—Set the default file permissions.

== Environment commands
=== Introduction

So far, we have discussed two methods to interact with Bash

* command
* hoykeys

A third method is environmental variables.

An environmental variables is a sequence of characters ket in memory and retrieved by a label.

VAR=myvariable

=== alias-define or display aliases

=== id-print real and effective user and group IDs
=== which-locate a command
=== whereis-locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command

=== popd
=== Environment variables
==== export-set export attribute for shell variables
==== env-run a program in a modified environment
==== PATH
==== CDPATH
==== PWD
==== USER

== Archiving and backup commands
=== gzip—Compress or expand files.
=== bzip2—A block sorting file compressor.
=== tar —Tape-archiving utility.
=== zip —Package and compress files.
=== rsync-a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool

== Text processing commands
=== wc-print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
=== uniq-report or omit repeated lines
=== head-output the first part of files
=== tail-output the last part of files
=== sort—Sort lines of text files.
=== cut —Remove sections from each line of files.
=== paste—Merge lines of files.
=== join—Join lines of two files on a common field.
=== tr—Translate or delete characters.
=== sed —Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
=== aspell—Interactive spell checker.

== Redirection and piping operators
=== '>: redirect output'
=== '<: redirect input'
=== '>>: redirect output to append'
=== '<<: here document'
=== '<<<: here string'
=== '|: pipe'

== Path resolution
=== absolute and relative paths
=== ''
=== ""
=== File globbing
==== wildcards
==== *
==== ?
==== '[]'
==== !
=== Command expansion
==== tilde
==== arithmetic
==== brace
==== parameter
==== command
=== Command grouping
==== ;
==== &&
== Command history
=== history
=== History environment variables
==== HISTCODE
==== HISTFILESIZE
==== HISTIGNORE
==== HISTSIZE

=== Hotkeys

A second way to interact with Bash is via _hotkeys_. A hotkey is a combination of keyboard buttons that produce no visible input on the command prompt like typing commands does but still instructs Bash to do something.

A commonly used hotkey is `CTRL-c`. It is made by pressing the button labeled `CTRL` on the keyboard with the `c` button. It immediately stops whatever the command prompt is doing and starts a new command prompt. Let's say we start to enter an `echo` command but change our mind:

[source, bash]
----
$ echo \"A common
----

If we press CTRL-c *before* typing enter, we get a bare command prompt.

`$`

`echo` never executed.

CTRL-c is a quick method to exit whatever we are doing and obtaining a fresh command prompt.

Hotkeys do not need to be pressed at the exact same time. Normally one presses `CTRL` and while holding it down presses `c`.
