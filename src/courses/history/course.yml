          * from the beginning of the universe
          * to the present moment.

          Big history initially examines
          * large scale eras,
          * trends, and
          * cause-and effect relationships,
          leaving details to ordinary history and science courses.

          This lesson is about the *cosmological* era. The cosmological era, lasting from the beginning of the Universe 13.7 Ga to the formation of the solar system 4.6 Ga, is also divided into four eras:
          * the *promordial* era, beginning with the Big Bang, when the Universe contained only radiation and atomic nuclei;
          * the *atomic* era, when the Universe cooled enough for atoms to form, 380 ka;
          * the *stellar era*, when stars began to form 200 Ma after the Big Bang; and
          * the *galactic* era, when galaxies formed, 1 Ga after the Big Bang.</ul>
