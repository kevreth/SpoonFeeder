                  <li>basic computer operations, such as using a mouse and the parts of a computer;</li>
                  <li>how to download and install software; and</li>
                  <li>what the World-Wide Web is and how to navigate it using a Web browser.</li>
                </ol>
                If you don't have this knowledge then gaining it first is recommended.

                <i>Client-side Web programming</i> is programming the browswer. This contrasts from server-size progarmming which programs the server a Web page originates from.

                Javascript is one of three technologies used for client-side programming. The full list is:
                <ol>
                  <li>HTML</li>
                  <li>CSS</li>
                  <li>Javascript</li>
                <ol>
                HTML and CSS each have dedicated courses. Client-side Javascript cannot be used independently of HTML, so we will cover basic HTML here. Basic CSS will be covered much later in this course.

                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
                <i>Hypertext</i> means text content that is "active" such as the ability to use hyperlinks. Printed documents cannot use hypertext, only computers can.
                A <i>Markup Language</p> is a type of computer language that isn't for prgrogramming. Intead, it is used to describe text documents. For example <code><b>This is boldface</b></code>. The <b> and </b> are markup to indicate the text should be displayed as boldface.

                Visual Studio Code is the most popular text editor for Javascript code. 
                Download it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>. However,
                it is not necessary for this course.
