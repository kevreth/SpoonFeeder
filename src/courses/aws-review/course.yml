        o:
        - Stop guessing about capacity
        - Increase speed and agility
        - Switch to a CAPEX model
        - Depreciate assets over a longer timeframe
        - Gain greater control of data center security
        numans: 2
        exp: |
          * Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes'''' notice
          * In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower
          * Cloud is based on an operational expenditure (OPEX) model, not a capital expenditure (CAPEX) model
          * Cloud does not provide the ability to depreciate assets over a longer timeframe as you generally do not own the assets
          * Though the AWS cloud does provide significant security standards for the data center, you do not get more control as this is an AWS responsibility
