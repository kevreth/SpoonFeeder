# compute
  # Cloud computing: is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications and other IT resources through a cloud services platform through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
  # Cloud-based deployment: run, migrate, design, and build both new and existing applications to the cloud
	# On-premises deployment: know as a private cloud deployment, deploy and increase resource by using virtualization and management tools
	# Hybrid deployment: splitting an application or software between on-premises and cloud infrastructure to take the benefits of both environments
	# Benefits of cloud computing:
		# Allows for trade-off between trade upfront expense and variable expense by paying for cloud services on a pay-as-you-go basic
		# Stop pending money to run and maintain data center
		# Stop guessing capacity for hardware and infrastructure, resources can be easily scaled up in or scale out in respond to demand
		# Benefit from massive economies of scale, cloud providers can offer services to a large number of customers which can reduce the cost of services for each individual customer
		# Increase speed and agility, by comparision, cloud computing enables to access new resources within minutes
		# Go global in minutes, with low latency
  # Instances (virtual machines)
    # Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	Secure and resizable compute capacity (virtual servers) in the cloud
      # types of EC2 instances (list use cases)
        # general purpose: provided a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, this is an instance family
        # compute optimized: use for a batch processing workload which offers high-performance processors
        # memory optimized: for workloads that process large datasets in memory, ideal for high-performance databases
        # accelerated computing: use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors that can expedite data processing
        # storage optimized: designed for workloads that require hig, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage, suitable for data warehousing applications
      # EC2 pricing:
		    # On-demand: ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted, pay for only the compute time you use
		    # Saving plans: enable to reduce compute costs by committing to a consistent amout of compute usage for 1 or 3 year term and can reduce costs by up to 72%
		    # Spot instances: ideal for workloads it does not require a minimum contract length, and that can withstand interruptions and can reduce costs by up to 90%
        # Reserved Instances: require a commitment of either 1 year or 3 years. The 3-year option offers a larger discount.
		    # Dedicated Instances: run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. They have a higher cost than the other response options, which run on shared hardware.
