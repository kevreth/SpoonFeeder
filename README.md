# SpoonFeeder

_programmed instruction on overdrive_

SpoonFeeder is programmed instruction software that takes advantage of recent advances in gamification. SpoonFeeder breaks learning content into around three simple slides, asks concept-checking questions, and then learners complete exercises of various types, such as multiple choice, gap fill, and sort.

## Advantages

1. Using continuous questioning to engage active learning
2. Rapid progress through easy input. All the questions are closed-form, often requiring one click to respond to, saving time.
3. Randomization of exercise order and for certain questions, response choices, to minimize work copying in classrooms.
4. Anyone can create content

SpoonFeeder is not designed to assess learners' ability to expound on a topic. The idea is to quickly commit concepts and rote material to the brain for later contemplation. An ideal use would be in a flipped classroom, where learners know the material fairly well before class and use class time to find gaps in their knowledge, collaborate with other students, and instructors can use higher-level teaching methods like dialectics. SpoonFeeder leaves instructors free to focus on high-level thinking skills.

## Roles

* test preparation,
* corporate training programs,
* continuing education,
* professional development,
* learning languages, and, to a lesser extent,
* common skills like money management, cooking, or sports rules.

## Uses

* replace most textbook content, with exceptions including open-form questions like short answer and essays;
* replace lectures involving concepts and terms;
* teach any subject involving book learning;
* create one-off quizzes and assignments; and
* convey information as text, images, audio, or video.

## Status

SpoonFeeder remains in an early pre-release state. Although functional, it's missing major features and the user interface needs attention.
