Step	Action	Why It Works
1️⃣	Rewrite the quadratic equation in standard form	Ensures all terms are on one side
2️⃣	Identify a, b, and c	Defines the structure of the equation
3️⃣	Factor the quadratic expression	Breaks the equation into two simpler expressions
4️⃣	Apply the Zero Product Property	Converts the equation into solvable parts
5️⃣	Solve for xx	Identifies the final solution
